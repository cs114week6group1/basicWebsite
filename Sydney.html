        <h2>Sydney Opera House</h2>
        <p>The Sydney Opera House is one of the most-photographed buildings in the
            world, known for its unique use of a series of gleaming white sail-shaped
            shells as its roof structure. The iconic performing arts facility is Sydney's
            best-known landmark.</p>

        <h2>Bondi Beach</h2>
        <p>Bondi beach is unique because of the following reasons: It is one of the best
            beaches in the world. The parked sand, the rocks, the water and the warm temperature
            combine to make the experience at Bondi beach like no other. You can surf waves or lie
            down on a blanket on the beach.</p>

        <h2>Taronga zoo</h2>
        <p>In 100 years Taronga has evolved from a location of entertainment to a mature conservation and education hub.
            In the spirit of reconciliation, Taronga acknowledges the unique status of Australiaâ€™s First Peoples as the original
            people of this land. We recognise their cultures, histories and ongoing relationship and obligations to the land and waterways.</p>
