            <h2>Three places in London we highly recommend</h2>

            <h3>HARRODS - Knightsbridge</h3>

            <p>Harrods motto is "Omnia Omnibus Ubique" which translates as "all things, for all people, everywhere"
            and they are certainly not exaggerating. With 330 departments spanning more than 1 million square
            feet of Retail space it would be difficult to think of a need that Harrods doesn't cater for. Peruse
            their extensive food halls for fine delicacies such as ostrich eggs and oysters, make yourself
            smell fabulous in their perfumery and look the part in Harrod's Egyptian styled clothing department.</p>

        <div class = "col-6">
            <h3>THE LONDON EYE - Lambeth</h3>

            <p>This famous attraction is truly a photographer's dream, offering panoramic views of Westminster,
                Covent Garden, Soho and the course of the Thames river. At its peak, you'll be 135 meters in the air.
                Every year, on New Year's Eve, the London Eye is lit up with lights and fireworks are launched from
                around it at the stroke of midnight to welcome in the new year.

            <h3>THE TOWER OF LONDON - Tower Hill</h3>

            <p>
                The Tower of London is a famous London landmark with a very rich history. During the 16th and 17th
                centuries, people including Elizabeth I and Sir Walter Rayleigh were imprisoned here. The tours of
                the tower led by the resident Yeomen (and their ravens) are absolutely fascinating, with one of the
                best parts of the tour being seeing the crown jewels worn by Her Majesty during such ceremonies as
                the state opening of parliament. There are also opportunities to see the dungeons used as prison cells
                for those unfortunate enough to be imprisoned there and rooms formerly used as banqueting and sleeping
                chambers by resident kings.
